              Talking about myself, I am a software engineer by profession, A
              'FULL STACK DEVELOPER'. With around two and a half years of
              experience (as of April 16, 2020) in web technologies, I have
              worked intensively on a lot of projects and technologies like
              dotnet(Web forms, MVC, Core), Angular(6, 7, 8), SQL, Node, React,
              MongoDB. This applcation has been developed as a result of me,
              deciding to learn REACT at the time when we were all sitting at
              our homes (probably), quarantined amidst corona virus fears. Just
              my first project in this library.
